# Claude Skill Auditor & Central Repository Manager

## Overview

Two responsibilities:
1. **Audit** — Analyze SKILL.md bundles: extract metadata, detect overlap, produce cleanup plans with merge proposals.
2. **Central Repo** — Manage a central skills repository (`$HOME/.claude-skills-repo`), symlink skills into projects, migrate scattered skills, and keep everything in sync.

**Two-turn protocol (audit mode):** On the first message describing an audit task, confirm understanding and request the skill bundle. Do not analyze until the bundle is provided.

**MANDATORY: Every operation ends with `skillshare sync`** to distribute changes across all AI tool targets.

## When to Use

### Audit Triggers
- User pastes multiple SKILL.md files and asks for analysis
- User wants to find duplicate or overlapping skills
- User wants a consolidation or cleanup plan for their skill library
- User asks which skills to merge, archive, or delete

### Central Repository Triggers
- User wants to set up a central skills repository
- User wants to share skills across multiple projects
- User wants to migrate project-level skills into a central location
- User wants to sync new skills to existing projects
- User asks to audit which projects use which skills
- User wants to verify symlink health across projects

## Part 1: Skill Audit

### Parsing Rules

Split input into skills using the strongest available delimiter:
1. `=== SKILL: <name> ===` (preferred)
2. `# SKILL: <name>` or `## SKILL: <name>`
3. If boundaries are ambiguous → create an `UNSURE_BOUNDARY` note; never guess

For each skill extract:
- `skill_name` — from delimiter; if missing, use `Unnamed Skill NN` and flag as uncertain
- `short_description` — 1–2 sentences
- `main_category` — from taxonomy below
- `notable_allowed_tools / hooks / side_effects` — tool whitelists, file writes, APIs, memory writes, external sends; if not specified → mark as "Not specified" and flag as governance risk

### Output Order

#### A) Per-Skill Extraction
Compact structured list (Markdown bullets or JSON) with all fields above plus `uncertainty_notes`.

#### B) Consolidation Table

| skill_name | main_category | similar_skills | overlap_level | recommended_action | rationale |

**overlap_level:** low / medium / high (see rubric below)
**recommended_action:** keep / merge / disable / archive / delete

#### C) Merge Candidates (high overlap only)
For each group:
- Proposed consolidated skill name
- 1–2 sentence description
- Core instructions as bullets
- What to deprecate and why
- Migration notes (content from old skills that must be preserved)

#### D) Prioritized Cleanup Checklist (10–15 items)
1. Quick wins first: duplicates, obvious merges, dead skills
2. Rewrites: vague descriptions, missing tool constraints
3. Governance: naming conventions, category taxonomy, templates

### Overlap Scoring Rubric

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **High** | Same purpose, similar steps, same tools/hook patterns — mostly duplicate |
| **Medium** | Same domain but different workflows or constraints |
| **Low** | Loosely related; minimal shared intent |

**Overlap indicators:** same trigger/goal verbs · same inputs/outputs · same tools or side effects · similar examples or templates

## Part 2: Central Skills Repository

### Environment

```bash
SKILLS_REPO="${CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO:-$HOME/.claude-skills-repo}"
```

Use `$CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO` env var if set, otherwise default to `$HOME/.claude-skills-repo`. This allows team members to use different paths.

### Step 1: Initialize Central Repository

Run when the central repo doesn't exist yet:

```bash
SKILLS_REPO="${CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO:-$HOME/.claude-skills-repo}"

if [ ! -d "$SKILLS_REPO" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$SKILLS_REPO"
    cd "$SKILLS_REPO"
    git init
    cat > README.md << 'HEREDOC'
# Central Claude Skills Repository

Single source of truth for reusable Claude skills.
Each subdirectory contains a skill with its SKILL.md and supporting files.

## Structure
- `<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — one directory per skill
- Projects symlink to skills they need from here
- Changes here propagate instantly to all linked projects
- Use `$CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO` env var to override the default path
HEREDOC
    git add -A && git commit -m "Initialize central skills repository"
    echo "Central repo created at $SKILLS_REPO"
else
    echo "Central repo already exists at $SKILLS_REPO"
fi
```

### Step 2: Scan & Migrate Existing Skills

First, scan for all project-level skills:

```bash
SKILLS_REPO="${CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO:-$HOME/.claude-skills-repo}"

echo "=== Scanning for project-level skills ==="
find ~/ -path "*/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md" \
    -not -path "*/.claude-skills-repo/*" \
    -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
    2>/dev/null | while read skillfile; do
    skill_dir=$(dirname "$skillfile")
    skill_name=$(basename "$skill_dir")
    project_dir=$(echo "$skill_dir" | sed 's|/.claude/skills/.*||')

    # Check if it's already a symlink
    if [ -L "$skill_dir" ]; then
        target=$(readlink "$skill_dir")
        echo "  LINKED: $skill_name ($project_dir) -> $target"
    else
        echo "  LOCAL:  $skill_name ($project_dir)"
    fi
done
```

To migrate a specific skill:

```bash
migrate_skill() {
    local SKILL_NAME="$1"
    local SOURCE_PROJECT="$2"
    local SKILLS_REPO="${CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO:-$HOME/.claude-skills-repo}"
    local SOURCE="$SOURCE_PROJECT/.claude/skills/$SKILL_NAME"

    if [ ! -d "$SOURCE" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: $SOURCE does not exist"
        return 1
    fi

    if [ -L "$SOURCE" ]; then
        echo "SKIP: $SKILL_NAME is already a symlink"
        return 0
    fi

    if [ -d "$SKILLS_REPO/$SKILL_NAME" ]; then
        echo "WARNING: $SKILL_NAME already exists in central repo"
        echo "  Central: $(head -5 "$SKILLS_REPO/$SKILL_NAME/SKILL.md")"
        echo "  Local:   $(head -5 "$SOURCE/SKILL.md")"
        echo "  Skipping — resolve manually (diff the two versions)"
        return 1
    fi

    # Copy to central repo
    cp -r "$SOURCE" "$SKILLS_REPO/$SKILL_NAME"
    # Remove original and create symlink
    rm -rf "$SOURCE"
    ln -s "$SKILLS_REPO/$SKILL_NAME" "$SOURCE"

    echo "MIGRATED: $SKILL_NAME -> $SKILLS_REPO/$SKILL_NAME"
    ls -la "$SOURCE"
}
```

### Step 3: Link Skills to a Project

```bash
link_skills() {
    local PROJECT_DIR="$1"
    local MODE="${2:-all}"  # "all" or skill name
    local SKILLS_REPO="${CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO:-$HOME/.claude-skills-repo}"

    mkdir -p "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills"

    if [ "$MODE" = "all" ]; then
        # Link ALL skills
        for skill_dir in "$SKILLS_REPO"/*/; do
            local skill_name=$(basename "$skill_dir")
            [ -f "$skill_dir/SKILL.md" ] || continue
            [ "$skill_name" = ".git" ] && continue
            if [ -L "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/$skill_name" ]; then
                echo "  SKIP: $skill_name (already linked)"
                continue
            fi
            ln -s "$SKILLS_REPO/$skill_name" "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/$skill_name"
            echo "  LINKED: $skill_name"
        done
    else
        # Link single skill
        if [ ! -d "$SKILLS_REPO/$MODE" ]; then
            echo "ERROR: Skill '$MODE' not found in central repo"
            return 1
        fi
        ln -s "$SKILLS_REPO/$MODE" "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/$MODE"
        echo "  LINKED: $MODE"
    fi
}
```

**Link by tag** (requires `.tags` file in skill directory):

```bash
link_by_tag() {
    local PROJECT_DIR="$1"
    local TAG="$2"
    local SKILLS_REPO="${CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO:-$HOME/.claude-skills-repo}"

    mkdir -p "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills"

    for skill_dir in "$SKILLS_REPO"/*/; do
        [ -f "$skill_dir/.tags" ] || continue
        if grep -q "$TAG" "$skill_dir/.tags"; then
            local skill_name=$(basename "$skill_dir")
            [ -L "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/$skill_name" ] && continue
            ln -s "$skill_dir" "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/$skill_name"
            echo "  LINKED (tag=$TAG): $skill_name"
        fi
    done
}
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup

```bash
verify_project() {
    local PROJECT_DIR="${1:-$(pwd)}"
    local SKILLS_REPO="${CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO:-$HOME/.claude-skills-repo}"
    local ok=0 broken=0 local_count=0

    echo "=== Symlinked Skills ($PROJECT_DIR) ==="
    for entry in "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills"/*/; do
        local name=$(basename "${entry%/}")
        if [ -L "${entry%/}" ]; then
            local target=$(readlink "${entry%/}")
            if [ -f "$target/SKILL.md" ]; then
                echo "  OK: $name -> $target"
                ((ok++))
            else
                echo "  BROKEN: $name -> $target (SKILL.md missing!)"
                ((broken++))
            fi
        elif [ -d "$entry" ]; then
            echo "  LOCAL: $name (not symlinked)"
            ((local_count++))
        fi
    done

    echo ""
    echo "=== Available in Central Repo (not linked) ==="
    for skill_dir in "$SKILLS_REPO"/*/; do
        local skill_name=$(basename "$skill_dir")
        [ -f "$skill_dir/SKILL.md" ] || continue
        [ "$skill_name" = ".git" ] && continue
        if [ ! -L "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/$skill_name" ] && \
           [ ! -d "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/$skill_name" ]; then
            local desc=$(sed -n '/^description:/s/^description: *//p' "$skill_dir/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
            echo "  AVAILABLE: $skill_name — $desc"
        fi
    done

    echo ""
    echo "Summary: $ok linked, $broken broken, $local_count local-only"

    if [ "$broken" -gt 0 ]; then
        echo ""
        echo "Fix broken symlinks:"
        echo "  find \"$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/\" -type l ! -exec test -e {} \\; -print"
    fi
}
```

### Step 5: Sync New Skills to Projects

After adding new skills to the central repo, detect what's new:

```bash
sync_new_skills() {
    local PROJECT_DIR="${1:-$(pwd)}"
    local SKILLS_REPO="${CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO:-$HOME/.claude-skills-repo}"
    local new_count=0

    echo "=== New skills available for $PROJECT_DIR ==="
    for skill_dir in "$SKILLS_REPO"/*/; do
        local skill_name=$(basename "$skill_dir")
        [ -f "$skill_dir/SKILL.md" ] || continue
        [ "$skill_name" = ".git" ] && continue
        if [ ! -L "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/$skill_name" ] && \
           [ ! -d "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/$skill_name" ]; then
            local desc=$(sed -n '/^description:/s/^description: *//p' "$skill_dir/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
            echo "  NEW: $skill_name"
            [ -n "$desc" ] && echo "       $desc"
            ((new_count++))
        fi
    done

    if [ "$new_count" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "  All central repo skills are already linked."
    else
        echo ""
        echo "$new_count new skill(s) available. Link with:"
        echo "  ln -s \"\$SKILLS_REPO/<name>\" \"$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/<name>\""
    fi
}
```

### Step 6: Git Integration

```bash
commit_central_repo() {
    local SKILLS_REPO="${CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO:-$HOME/.claude-skills-repo}"
    cd "$SKILLS_REPO"
    git add -A
    if ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
        git commit -m "Update skills: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
        echo "Central repo committed."
    else
        echo "Central repo: no changes to commit."
    fi
}
```

In project repos, symlinks are committed as-is — collaborators need the same `$CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO` path or the env var set.

### Step 7: Cross-Project Audit

List all projects using a specific skill:

```bash
audit_skill_usage() {
    local SKILL_NAME="$1"
    local SKILLS_REPO="${CLAUDE_SKILLS_REPO:-$HOME/.claude-skills-repo}"

    echo "=== Projects using '$SKILL_NAME' ==="
    find ~/ -lname "*/.claude-skills-repo/$SKILL_NAME" 2>/dev/null | while read link; do
        local project=$(echo "$link" | sed 's|/.claude/skills/.*||')
        echo "  $project"
    done
}
```

## Part 3: Troubleshooting

### Broken Symlink
```bash
# Find all broken symlinks
find .claude/skills/ -type l ! -exec test -e {} \; -print

# Fix: remove and recreate
rm .claude/skills/broken-skill
ln -s "$HOME/.claude-skills-repo/broken-skill" .claude/skills/broken-skill
```

### Skill Not Loading
1. Verify SKILL.md exists: `cat .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. Check symlink resolves: `ls -L .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
3. Ensure frontmatter is valid YAML between `---` markers

## Category Taxonomy

- Content Transformation (translate, rewrite, summarize)
- Research & Enrichment (web research, expansion, citations)
- Document & File Ops (PDF/DOCX/XLSX generation/editing)
- Web & Automation (scraping, scheduled tasks, monitoring)
- Dev & Integration (APIs, pipelines, codegen, CI/CD)
- Creative / Media (image/video prompts, branding)
- Governance / Meta (auditing, linting, policy enforcement)
- Skill Management (repo setup, symlinks, sync, migration) ← NEW

## Integrity Rules

- Never invent tool permissions or side effects
- If a skill omits tools → "Not specified" + governance risk flag
- If a delimiter is missing → label uncertain + propose fix
- Every recommendation must be justified:
  - "Merge" → include concrete consolidated skill spec
  - "Disable/Archive/Delete" → cite specific reason (duplicate, obsolete, too vague, risky, unused assumptions)
- **Never `rm -rf` symlinked skills** — this deletes the source. Use `skillshare uninstall` or manual `rm` on the symlink only.

## Optional: Governance Template

If the skill set is messy, propose a standardized SKILL.md template:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
version: 1.0.0
owner: <team/person>
category: <from taxonomy>
description: Use when...
---

# Skill Name

## Triggers
## Inputs / Outputs
## Allowed Tools & Side Effects
## Safety Constraints
## Examples
## Acceptance Criteria
```

## Common Mistakes

- Analyzing before receiving the bundle (violates two-turn handshake)
- Inventing tool permissions when a skill doesn't mention them
- Recommending "merge" without providing the actual merged spec
- Using a category set that grows unbounded — keep to the 8 categories above unless a clear gap exists
- Running `rm -rf` on a symlink target instead of removing the symlink
- Forgetting to run sync after making changes

---

## MANDATORY: Final Sync

**Every operation performed by this skill MUST end with a `skillshare sync` command.**

After any audit, migration, linking, verification, or repo change:

```bash
echo ""
echo "=== Running final skillshare sync ==="
skillshare sync
echo "=== Sync complete ==="
```

This ensures all changes are distributed across all configured AI tool targets (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.). Never skip this step.

**Notes on sync:**
- Personal global skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) load for ALL projects automatically — no symlinks needed
- Project skills (`.claude/skills/`) only load for that project — use symlinks to share
- `skillshare sync` handles distributing from source of truth to all targets
- If `skillshare` is not installed, warn the user and provide fallback manual sync guidance
